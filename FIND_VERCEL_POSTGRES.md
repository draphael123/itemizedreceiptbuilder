# Where to Find Vercel Postgres

## Why It Might Not Be in That List

The list you're seeing (Neon, Supabase, Prisma Postgres, etc.) is likely the **"Integrations"** or **"Third-Party Services"** section. These are external database providers that integrate with Vercel.

**Vercel Postgres** is Vercel's **native** database service, so it's usually in a **different section**.

## Where to Find Vercel Postgres

### Option 1: Storage Tab (Most Common)

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Look for the **"Storage"** tab (not "Integrations")
3. Click **"Storage"** → **"Create Database"**
4. You should see **"Postgres"** as a Vercel-native option

### Option 2: Different Button/Location

Vercel Postgres might be accessed via:
- A **"Create Database"** button at the top
- Under **"Vercel Services"** or **"Native Services"**
- A separate **"Databases"** section
- In the project overview, look for **"Add Storage"** or **"Add Database"**

### Option 3: It Might Be Called Something Else

Look for:
- **"Postgres"** (without "Vercel" in the name)
- **"Vercel Database"**
- **"Native Postgres"**

## If You Don't See It

### Possible Reasons:

1. **Account Type**: Vercel Postgres might require a Pro plan (check your Vercel plan)
2. **Region**: Might not be available in all regions
3. **New Feature**: Might be rolling out gradually

### Alternative: Use Prisma Postgres

If you can't find Vercel Postgres, **Prisma Postgres** is an excellent alternative:
- ✅ Made by Prisma (the tool you're using)
- ✅ Works seamlessly with Prisma
- ✅ Serverless and easy to use
- ✅ Free tier available

## What to Look For

When you find the right section, you should see:
- **"Postgres"** or **"Vercel Postgres"**
- Description like: "Managed PostgreSQL database"
- No external account required
- Integrated with Vercel deployments

## Quick Check

1. **Look at the top of your Vercel dashboard** - Is there a **"Storage"** or **"Databases"** tab?
2. **Check the project settings** - Sometimes it's under Settings → Storage
3. **Look for "Add" or "Create" buttons** - Might be a prominent button to add storage

## Recommendation

If you can't find Vercel Postgres easily, just use **Prisma Postgres** from that list - it's actually a great choice and will work perfectly with your setup!
